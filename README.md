## Download In-house Labeling
The in-house data labeling for feature matching in gastroscopy scenario can be downloaded via the Baidu Cloud link：
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rPriqu2e0ceMw9he9iofqg 

password：`b1c3`

Each set includes two images to be matched and a JSON file annotated by professional doctors with 60 matching pairs.

Gastroscopy video clips annotated with forward or backward directions can be downloaded via the Baidu Cloud link：

The performance of the feature matching methods can be validated through this downstream task.

More in-house data labeling will be supplemented here shortly after they are approved for public release.
